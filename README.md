# DYNAMIC-DATA-STRUCTURE-BASED-IMAGE-SECURITY-METHOD

This project, DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE-BASED IMAGE SECURITY METHOD, introduces a novel approach to image cryptography, offering a robust solution for securing visual data during transmission or storage. By leveraging dynamic data structures, specifically binary trees and hash tables, this method provides an efficient and secure technique for image scrambling and descrambling. The scrambling process utilizes a binary tree structure to rearrange pixel intensities, effectively obscuring the original image content. Conversely, the descrambling process employs a complementary technique using hash tables to accurately reconstruct the original image. This approach ensures the integrity of image data while providing a strong layer of obfuscation. The method can be applied in various scenarios where image security is paramount, including secure image transmission over networks, protection of sensitive visual data in storage systems, and digital rights management for visual content. This project is part of ongoing research in the field of image cryptography and data security, aiming to address the growing need for robust security measures in digital communication.
